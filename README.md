# Jack-o-nine-remake-by-aoe
Basic Test version

The aim is to recreate Jack-o-Nine in visual studio, the initial goal is to rewrite the game, then after, add more to it.

I am rewriting the game to allow easily customisation, a better save systems, and make it more easily changeable.

Let's talk a bit about the game:

If you are on here, you probably think that Jack-o-Nine is the best Slave Maker game. I agree, the reasons that I have identified is:

*It's a solid game.

*You can talk to the girls, which adds a little bit of personalisation, and to the immersion. 

*The pictures are immersive (not overly sexual, but sexual enough).

*The game is mostly a sandbox.

Together you basically never break immersion (it's easy to imagine yourself as the slaver, and forget you are someone playing a game). 

Ultimately any changes need to keep this idea and work on building up the world in a passive way: you shouldn't hear (read) your slaver talk as that turns the game into you watching your slaver talk, instead of you being the slaver and this is what you want to do, you shouldn't have lore jammed down your throat.

After the basic remake is complete, I also want to balance the less useful options (like school/tutor) and also add more where appropriate (maybe quests which make things cheaper, different fights).
